# Hey 👋

I’m into **cybersecurity**, **cryptography**, and **Linux** — mostly on **ThinkPads**.  
I like building practical tools and setups that I can actually use every day.

## What you’ll find here
- ThinkPad-focused Linux configs (tweaks, power, stability)
- security tools and small experiments (Python/Bash)
- networking & hardening notes
- crypto learning projects and implementations
- homelab / self-hosting stuff

## Tech
Python • Bash • Git • SSH • Docker

## Current focus
Building a solid **ThinkPad + Linux** workflow and improving my skills in **network security** and **cryptography**.
